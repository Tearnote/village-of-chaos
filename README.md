# Village of Chaos: a browser game

_Village of Chaos_ is an incremental game written in Javascript, made for [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)'s 2nd submission project. The goal of the game is to build a village, bit by bit, and manage your villagers' jobs to maximize their potential.

## Motivation

Ever since the the advent of [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/), incremental games have enjoyed a huge rise in popularity, topping the charts of mobile app stores. The simple gameplay makes them appealing to people less skilled in videogames, and they can be created very rapidly with little graphical content by any aspiring game designer. _Village of Chaos_ is a "management" type incremental, where workers can be assigned to automate tasks. However, the driving idea behind this game is that increasing the number of units assigned to the same task doesn't neccessarily result in a speedup, as the team becomes uncoordinated and chaotic. The player will need to research and apply management techniques to keep the team efficient and the production high.
